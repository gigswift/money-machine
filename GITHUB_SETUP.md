# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions for Trading Money Machine

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com** and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `money-machine`
   - **Description**: `Trading Money Machine - A sophisticated multi-agent algorithmic trading system with real-time web interface, technical analysis, and risk management`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash

# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/money-machine.git

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Step 3: Verify Upload

`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/money-machine`
